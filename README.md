# üîê **<ins>Cybersecurity Vault: Tiffany's GitHub Showcase**
Welcome to my Cybersecurity Vault! This repository is a creative demonstration of Git and GitHub functionalities, inspired by my journey in tech and cybersecurity.

## About the Vault
This repository includes:
* ‚úÖ Demonstrations of six markdown features.
* ü™ß A README file to guide you through the vault's contents. 
* üõ°Ô∏è A .gitignore file acting as the "firewall" of the vault. 

## Features of the Vault

| **Markdown Feature** | **Descriptions**                                |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Headings             | Structured sections for clarity.                |
| Code Blocks          | Example Git commands to secure your repository. |
| Inline Links         | Quick access to learning resources.             |
| Tables               | Organised information for easy understanding.   |
| Images               | Visual aids to enhance learning.                |
| Checklists           | A summary of tasks and accomplishments.         |

## How to Use the Vault
1. Clone the repository:
`git clone <repository_url>`
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   * Use the `requirements.txt file to set up the necessary dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Explore the markdown files to learn about Git and GitHub features.
4. Check the `.gitignore` file:
   * The `.gitignore` file is used to prevent certain files or directories from being tracked by Git
   * In this project, I've used `.gitignore` to stop tracking `.idea` files (created in IDEs like PyCharm) to avoid sharing local configuration files.
   * This function is especially helpful when working collaboratively to develop and deploy digital products, as it keeps unnecessary or environment-specific files out of the repository. Keeping the project clean!

### About requirements.txt
I added the `requirements.txt`file to my directory using the command `pip freeze > requirements.txt`. See image below:

*Function*: The `requirements.txt` file lists the external libraries needed for this project. It ensures that anyone working on the project can easily install the correct versions of the libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This helps maintain consistency and compatibility across different environments.
