# Threat Intelligence APIüßôüèæ
This project is a simple, yet powerful Threat Intelligence API designed to track and report various types of 
cybersecurity threats. The API allows users to view known threats, fetch detailed information about specific 
threats, and report new threats. It is backed by a MySQL database and features endpoints to interact with the
data in a meaningful and organised way.

The project demonstrates the application of Flask for building web APIs, SQL for database management, and best
practices in exception handling. The API is designed to be easily extendable and could be further developed to integrate
with threat intelligence platforms or real-time monitoring systems.
